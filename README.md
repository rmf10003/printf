DESCRIPTION
       The  _printf  function  replicates  the  functionality  of the regular
       printf. It is currently in beta and open to contributors.  If  you  or
       someone  you  know has been diagnosed with no_checker_checks syndrome,
       helping us complete _printf may be the cure.

       ters printed.

       print out different types of output.
